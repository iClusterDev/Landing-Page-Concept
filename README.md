# landing-page

### Design Concept

This project is part of the FCC challenges within the Responsive Web Design section.
\
The landing page is developed using Sass and VanillaJS. All the Sass code is compiled into CSS and the JavaScript is transpiled (babel) using Webpack as a build tool. All the media files are compressed and optimized for production.
\
The project is aimed to achieve a clean and minimal design. The design process is done following the "Mobile First" guidelines.
